# Information on YasMonitors


## About
YasMonitors is web-monitoring service. It was created due to popular demand for the sneaker community, however as we expand these monitors will be provided to everyone that wants one.
These monitors aim to send a notification to a Discord webhook URL when a release or restock occurs, but we will also develop monitors that notify price reductions and discounts.


## How to Sign Up
Currently we are restricting the number of users as we start off and expand. So for now, please fill out the Google Form below and I'll select 20 people for our first customers. If you are chosen, you will be contacted via email or Discord where you are expected to purchase at least 1 monitor.

Later on, we will deploy a dashboard that will allow for anyone where you can create accounts, subscribe to specific monitors and customise them to their specifications.


## Why you should use this rather than the free ones?
These monitors are built differently to the ones on GitHub and will be faster.
Through this paid service, I will be actively updating the monitors, maintaining the servers that they are hosted on and use some of the best proxies to ensure minimal downtime.
With this service, you will not have to deal with any code or deployment - you just need to sign up and send me your Discord Webhook URL!


## Why you should use this rather than other competitors?
Many of the larger competitors that provide monitoring tools sell them in bulk for a large monthly price.
I allow cusotmers to purchase the monitors they want at a resonable price so that you don't get monitors that you don't need.
Overall this means that you can be paying a cheaper price for the same service.

I am also committed to delivering high customer service so will respond quick to any errors or disruption in service.


## How it works
The process is very simple and follows the steps below:
1. You sign up through our Google Form
2. If selected, you will be granted access to the YasMonitors Discord channel which will be used for updates on new monitors, mentions of any price changes and details of any downtime
3. You can purchase as many monitors as you want (for now capped at a maximum of 5 monitors per person). Each monitor is a monthly subscription and you will be able to unsubscribe at anytime
4. You provide the webhooks for each monitor that you purchase
5. I ensure that notification are delivered to you and that the service runs smoothly
6. I will keep updating the monitors and adding new ones


## Current Monitors
Below is a list of the current available monitors. As we start out, only a few monitors are available, however we are quickly expanding the monitors we can provide as well as the countries, so keep an eye out on this page.

Site | Locations | What it monitors
-----|-----------|------------------
SNKRS | UK, US | Restocks and Releases on SNKRS app
KITH | UK, US | Restocks and Releases
Nike | UK, US | Restocks and Releases

## Payments

Payments are handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and payment information is only stored with them. I have no access to payment information. I only have access to your name and email address. When you subscribe, you will recieve an email from Stripe for each monitor to pay for that month. If you miss a payment, you will not recieve notifications.


## Other Details

If any downtime occurs, it will only be for short periods, but you will be notified well in advance of these periods. Nevertheless this should not affect you as I will try to peform any maintenance outside of release dates/times.
