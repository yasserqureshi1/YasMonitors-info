# Information on YasMonitors


## About
YasMonitors is web-monitoring service. It was created due to popular demand for the sneaker community.
These monitors aim to send a notification to a Discord webhook URL when a release or restock occurs, but we are also developing monitors that notify price reductions and discounts.  


## How to Sign Up
Currently we are restricting users as we continue to expand and deploy. So for now, please fil out the Google Form below and I'll select 20 people as the first customers. If you are chosen, you are expected to purchase at least 1 monitor.

Later on, we will deploy a dashboard that will allow for anyone to create accounts, subscribe to specific monitors and customise them to their specifications.


## Why you should use this rather than the free ones?
These monitors are built differently to the ones on GitHub. 
Through this paid service, I will be actively maintaining and updating the monitors.
You will not have to deal with any code or deployment, you will only be required to provide the webhook URL.


## Why you should use this rather than other competitors?
Many of the larger competitors that provide monitoring tools sell them in bulk for a large monthly price.
I allow cusotmers to purchase the monitors they want at a resonable price so that you don't get monitors that you don't need.
Overall this means that you can be paying a cheaper price for the same service.

I am also committed to delivering high customer service so will respond quick to any errors or disruption in service.


## How it works
The process is very simple and follows the steps below:
1. You sign up to YasMonitors (currently a Google Form)
2. You will be granted access to the YasMonitors Discord channel which will be used for updates on new monitors, mentions of any price changes and details of any downtime
3. You can purchase as many monitors as you want. Each monitor is a monthly subscription and you will be able to unsubscribe at anytime
4. You provide the webhooks for each monitor that you purchase
5. I ensure that notification are delivered to you and that the service runs smoothly
6. I will keep updating the monitors and adding new ones


## Current Monitors

## Payments

Payments are handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and payment information is only stored with them. I have no access to payment information. I only have access to your name and email address.


## Other Details

Downtime may occur for short periods, but you will be notified well in advance of these periods. Nevertheless these should not affect you as I will try to peform any maintenance outside of release dates/times.
